## About me
I'm a software developer that started working on games development in C# & C++, from there I progressed to working on GIS applications across C#, C++ and Java on Windows, Linux and Android platforms. These days I'm mostly focused on building C# Applications from ASP.Net and blazor sites to pet project Discord bots.
